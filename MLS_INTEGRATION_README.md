### 2. MLS Official Scraper (`penaltyblog/scrapers/mls_official.py`)

```python
from penaltyblog.scrapers import MLSOfficial

# Initialize scraper
scraper = MLSOfficial(season="2024")

fixtures_df = scraper.get_fixtures()
```

**Features:**
- Official MLS website scraping
- Team metadata (conference, founding year, city)
- Fixtures and results parsing
- Standardized data output
- Robust error handling

### 3. League Configuration (`penaltyblog/config/leagues.yaml`)

MLS is configured as:
```yaml
USA_ML:
  name: "MLS"
  country: "United States"
  tier: 1
  season_id: "2024"
  url_template: "https://www.mlssoccer.com/schedule"
```

Access via:
```python
from penaltyblog.config.leagues import get_league_by_code

mls_league = get_league_by_code("USA_ML")
print(f"{mls_league.display_name}: {mls_league.url_template}")
```

### 4. Competition Mappings (`penaltyblog/scrapers/common.py`)

MLS added to `COMPETITION_MAPPINGS`:
```python
"USA Major League Soccer": {
    "fbref": {
        "slug": "22",
        "stats": ["standard", "goalkeeping", "advanced_goalkeeping", 
                 "shooting", "passing", "passing_types", 
                 "goal_shot_creation", "defensive_actions", 
                 "possession", "playing_time", "misc"],
    },
    "mls_official": {"base_url": "https://www.mlssoccer.com"},
    "espn": {"slug": "usa.1"},
}
```

### 5. Unified Scraper Integration (`penaltyblog/scrapers/unified_scraper.py`)

MLS integrated into the unified scraping framework:
```python
LEAGUE_TO_COMPETITION = {
    # ... existing leagues ...
    "USA_ML": "USA Major League Soccer",
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Team Information

```python
from penaltyblog.scrapers import MLSOfficial

# Initialize scraper
mls = MLSOfficial(season="2024")

# Get all teams
teams = mls.get_teams()

# Filter by conference
eastern_teams = teams[teams['conference'] == 'Eastern']
western_teams = teams[teams['conference'] == 'Western']

# Get specific team info
inter_miami = teams[teams['team_name'] == 'Inter Miami CF']
print(f"Founded: {inter_miami.iloc[0]['founded']}")
print(f"City: {inter_miami.iloc[0]['city']}")
```

### Team Name Mapping

```python
from penaltyblog.scrapers import get_mls_team_mappings

# Get mappings for data consistency
mappings = get_mls_team_mappings()

# Check aliases for a team
atlanta_aliases = mappings["Atlanta United FC"]
print(f"Atlanta United aliases: {atlanta_aliases}")
# Output: ['Atlanta United', 'ATL', 'Atlanta', 'ATLUTD']
```

### Using with FBRef

```python
from penaltyblog.scrapers import FBRef, get_mls_team_mappings

# Check if MLS is available in FBRef
if "USA Major League Soccer" in FBRef.list_competitions():
    # Initialize with MLS team mappings
    fbref = FBRef(
        competition="USA Major League Soccer",
        season="2024", 
        team_mappings=get_mls_team_mappings()
    )
    
    # Get fixtures
    fixtures = fbref.get_fixtures()
```

### Integration with Existing Workflow

```python
from penaltyblog.scrapers.unified_scraper import UnifiedScraper

# Use unified scraper for MLS
scraper = UnifiedScraper()
mls_data = scraper.scrape_league("USA_ML", season="2024")
```
