    "\n",
    "After cleaning and transforming individual records, a common next step in data analysis is to summarize information across different groups. For instance, you might want to count the total shots per team, find the average xG (Expected Goals) per player, or sum the number of passes made in different zones of the pitch. `Flow` provides powerful tools for these \"group by\" operations."
