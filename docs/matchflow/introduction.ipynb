    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow: a lazy, streaming data pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In football analytics, much of the data - events, matches, player tracking - is delivered as nested JSON records. These files can be large, noisy, and full of structure, but we often want to perform familiar operations: filtering, selecting fields, computing aggregates, or joining on player or match IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow is designed for exactly this: lightweight pipelines that operate on record streams without loading everything into memory. It’s built from the ground up for JSON-like dicts, meaning you can start processing immediately without flattening or reshaping your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Flow Works\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Flow` is like a smart conveyor belt for your records. You tell it what operations to perform - like `.filter()`, `.select()`, `.assign()` - and it remembers the plan without doing anything right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lazy, Chainable Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "When you build a Flow pipeline, you're chaining together a sequence of lazy transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow(events)\n",
    "shots = flow.filter(lambda r: r.get(\"type_name\") == \"Shot\")\n",
    "result = shots.select(\"player_name\", \"shot_xg\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, nothing has actually run. It’s only when you call a materializing method like `.collect()` or `.to_pandas()` that data is processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materialization: When Work Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flow` evaluates your pipeline only when necessary - this is called materialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.collect()` → returns a list of records\n",
    "- `.to_pandas()` → builds a DataFrame\n",
    "- `.to_jsonl(\"out.jsonl\")` → writes records to disk\n",
    "- `for r in flow` → begins processing the stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Until you do one of these, Flow remains idle and memory-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatically Safe to Reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though `Flow` is built like a generator, it’s safe to reuse. You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call `.first()`, `.head()`, `.collect()` multiple times\n",
    "- Loop over the same Flow again\n",
    "- Chain additional steps later\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flow` automatically preserves any records it’s seen before, so you never lose data by accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(flow.first())     # safe peek\n",
    "print(flow.head(3))     # still safe\n",
    "print(flow.collect())   # all data still there\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This buffering happens automatically behind the scenes using a Python technique called “teeing” (but you don’t need to know that to use it).\n",
    "\n",
    "## But Be Aware of Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `Flow` preserves previously accessed records, repeated reuse will buffer more data in memory over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan to inspect or reuse the data repeatedly, it's best to cache it explicitly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow.from_jsonl(\"data.jsonl\").cache()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This loads everything once and makes future operations fast and predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Nested JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Football data is often deeply nested. `Flow` helps you work with it naturally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow.select(\"player.name\")     # directly select nested field\n",
    "flow = flow.flatten()          # flatten all nested fields\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will flatten the data for you automatically, so you can focus on the operations you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flow’s` design offers practical advantages for sports analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scales to large files (record-by-record processing)\n",
    "- Starts fast (no up-front loading)\n",
    "- Plays well with JSON and dicts\n",
    "- Safe and repeatable by default\n",
    "- Easy to debug, branch, and explore\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand `Flow’s` model, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read files with `Flow.from_jsonl()` or `Flow.from_folder()`\n",
    "- Transform and select fields with `.filter()`, `.assign()`, `.select()`\n",
    "- Join datasets with `.join()`\n",
    "- Group and summarize with `.group_by().summary()`\n",
    "- Output data with `.to_jsonl()`, `.to_pandas()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flow` lets you write expressive, powerful pipelines that are fast, safe, and memory-conscious — perfect for event-level football data."
