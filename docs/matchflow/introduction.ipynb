    "# Introduction to Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow: a Lazy, Streaming Data Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In football analytics, much of the data - events, matches, tracking - is delivered as nested JSON records. These files can be large and complex, but the operations we want to perform are often familiar: filtering, selecting fields, computing aggregates, or joining on player and match IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow** is built for exactly this: lightweight, chainable pipelines that process streaming JSON-like `dict` records efficiently, without needing to load everything into memory upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Flow Works\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Flow` is like a conveyor belt of records. You define what should happen - `.filter()`, `.assign()`, `.group_by()` - and nothing is processed until you explicitly ask for results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lazy and Chainable\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow pipelines are lazy. You can freely chain transformations without triggering any computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow(events)\n",
    "shots = flow.filter(lambda r: r.get(\"type_name\") == \"Shot\")\n",
    "result = shots.select(\"player_name\", \"shot_xg\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No computation happens yet. This is just a recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Materialization: When Work Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flow` is single-pass. Once a pipeline is consumed - via iteration, conversion, or saving - it cannot be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materialization happens when you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call `.collect()` - returns a list of all records\n",
    "- Call `.to_pandas()` - builds a DataFrame\n",
    "- Use `for r in flow` - starts streaming records\n",
    "- Save to disk with `.to_jsonl()`, `.to_json_files()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Need to Reuse the Data? Use `.materialize()`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to inspect or reuse data across multiple steps, use `.materialize()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow.from_folder(\"data/json\").filter(...).assign(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a reusable, in-memory Flow\n",
    "data = flow.materialize()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now it's safe to reuse\n",
    "summary = data.group_by(\"team\").summary(...)\n",
    "df = data.filter(...).to_pandas()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This consumes the original stream and gives you a new `Flow` backed by a list - reusable and safe for repeated access.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Just Want the Results? Use `.collect()`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want the records as a list of dicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "records = Flow.from_folder(\"data/json\").filter(...).collect()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most basic way to get results, but it’s not reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Inspection Methods Consume the Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `Flow` is single-pass, even methods like `.first()`, `.head()`, and `.keys()` will consume the underlying records.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow(events)\n",
    "print(flow.first())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To safely inspect, materialize the stream first using `.materialize()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow(events).materialize()\n",
    "print(flow.first())    # safe\n",
    "print(flow.head(3))    # safe\n",
    "print(flow.keys())     # safe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Nested JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Football data is often deeply nested. `Flow` helps you work with it naturally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow.select(\"player.name\")     # directly select nested field\n",
    "flow = flow.flatten()          # flatten all nested fields\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will flatten the data for you automatically, so you can focus on the operations you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow** is built for the messy, structured nature of real-world football data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Streams large JSON files without loading everything at once\n",
    "- ✅ Chains transformations fluently and readably\n",
    "- ✅ Plays well with nested dicts\n",
    "- ✅ Avoids pandas until you need it\n",
    "- ✅ Keeps pipelines composable and inspectable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `.materialize()` if you plan to inspect or reuse data more than once\n",
    "- Avoid using `.first()`, `.head()`, or `.keys()` on unmaterialized streams - they consume the Flow\n",
    "- Think of `Flow` as a one-shot pipeline - just like Python's generators\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand `Flow`'s model, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read files with `Flow.from_jsonl()` or `Flow.from_folder()`\n",
    "- Transform and select fields with `.filter()`, `.assign()`, `.select()`\n",
    "- Join datasets with `.join()`\n",
    "- Group and summarize with `.group_by().summary()`\n",
    "- Output data with `.to_jsonl()`, `.to_pandas()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Flow` lets you write expressive, powerful data pipelines that are fast, safe, and memory-conscious."
