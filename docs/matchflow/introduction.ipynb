    "# Introduction to Flow  \n",
    "\n",
    "*A lazy, schema-aware pipeline for nested football data*\n",
    "\n",
    "In football analytics, a lot of data comes as **deeply nested JSON** - think event data, match metadata, freeze frames, and tracking points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet most tools flatten this structure too early, forcing everything into rigid tables. This leads to brittle pipelines, excessive cleanup, and premature decisions about schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow** takes a different approach: it treats nested JSON as a first-class citizen. It lets you build clear, chainable pipelines over structured records without needing to normalize everything first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† What is Flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow is a lightweight query engine for nested data. It gives you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lazy, chainable operations: `filter()`, `assign()`, `group_by()`, etc.\n",
    "- Natural access to nested fields (`\"player.name\"`, `\"location.x\"`)\n",
    "- Reusable, explainable pipelines\n",
    "- Outputs to JSONL, pandas, or disk - but only when you ask\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, Flow builds a **plan** - a list of transformation steps - and doesn‚Äôt execute anything until you call `.collect()` or `.to_pandas()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Example: Filter and Transform Shots\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.matchflow import Flow, where_equals, where_gt\n",
    "\n",
    "flow = (\n",
    "    Flow.from_folder(\"data/events/\")\n",
    "    .filter(\n",
    "        where_equals(\"type.name\", \"Shot\"),\n",
    "        where_gt(\"shot.stats.xG\", 0.2)\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .assign(xg_label=lambda r: \"High xG\" if r[\"shot\"][\"stats\"][\"xG\"] > 0.5 else \"Low xG\")\n",
    "    .select(\"player.name\", \"team.name\", \"xg_label\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "flow.show(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing is computed until the end, you‚Äôre building a lazy pipeline, not evaluating data immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Lazy Execution: Nothing Happens Until You Ask\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow‚Äôs operations are lazy. Every method adds a step to the internal plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Flow(...) ‚Üí .filter(...) ‚Üí .assign(...) ‚Üí .select(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But no records are actually processed until you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call `.collect()` ‚Üí get a list of records\n",
    "- Call `.to_pandas()` ‚Üí build a DataFrame\n",
    "- Call `.to_jsonl()` ‚Üí write to disk\n",
    "- Use a loop: `for row in flow`\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßä Reuse and Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Flows are built to be reusable. You can run `.collect()` multiple times, and even inspect the pipeline with `.explain()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow.explain()\n",
    "# Shows a step-by-step plan of your pipeline\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data source is expensive (e.g. API or big JSONL), cache it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow.from_jsonl(\"events.jsonl\").filter(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "cached = flow.cache()  # Runs once, stores the results\n",
    "\n",
    "df = cached.to_pandas()\n",
    "head = cached.head(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`.cache()` materializes the current records into memory and gives you a new Flow from that result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† A Different Way of Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow is not a dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs a pipeline builder for nested JSON - more like SQL or Spark, but designed for Python and football analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don‚Äôt flatten your data until you‚Äôre ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don‚Äôt write repetitive dict lookups or munging code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don‚Äôt worry about rows with missing tags or optional fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just write clear pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Mutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow may modify records in-place for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you care about preserving your original data, use `copy.deepcopy(data)` before passing it in.\n",
    "- Or call `.cache()` or `.materialize()` to freeze the state into a new memory-backed Flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Summary: Why Use Flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow is designed for working with real-world football data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Natural access to nested fields\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Lazy evaluation with reusability\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Built-in filter helpers (`where_equals`, `where_in`, `where_gt` etc)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Outputs to JSONL, pandas, or JSON\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Keeps pipelines readable and composable\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're flattening your data just to load it into pandas, Flow lets you skip that step, and work with the structure as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è Coming Soon: flowz Format\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm actively working on a fast, binary format (`.flowz`) for even faster loading, predicate pushdown, and indexing. For now, JSON and JSONL are fully supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí¨ Try it and break it\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install penaltyblog\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.matchflow import Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow.from_folder(\"data/\")\n",
    "    .filter(...)\n",
    "    .select(...)\n",
    "    .show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "If something doesn‚Äôt work, or you‚Äôre fighting the shape of your data, please open an issue or drop a note. That‚Äôs the point of v1."
