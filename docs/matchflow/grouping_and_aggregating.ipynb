    "# Grouping and Aggregating Data\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning and transforming individual records, the next step in data analysis is often to summarize information across different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count the number of shots per team  \n",
    "- Compute the average xG per player  \n",
    "- Sum the number of passes per zone  \n",
    "\n",
    "Flow provides powerful tools for these group-based operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÄ Grouping Records: `.group_by(...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `.group_by(...)` to define how records should be grouped. It takes one or more field names and returns a `FlowGroup` object - a pipeline for grouped records.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.matchflow import Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "sample_records = [\n",
    "    {\"event_id\": 1, \"type_name\": \"Pass\", \"team_name\": \"Manchester City\", \"player_name\": \"Kevin De Bruyne\"},\n",
    "    {\"event_id\": 2, \"type_name\": \"Shot\", \"team_name\": \"Manchester City\", \"player_name\": \"Erling Haaland\", \"shot_xg\": 0.05},\n",
    "    {\"event_id\": 3, \"type_name\": \"Duel\", \"team_name\": \"Manchester City\", \"player_name\": \"Rodri\"},\n",
    "    {\"event_id\": 4, \"type_name\": \"Pass\", \"team_name\": \"Manchester City\", \"player_name\": \"Kevin De Bruyne\"},\n",
    "    {\"event_id\": 5, \"type_name\": \"Shot\", \"team_name\": \"Arsenal\", \"player_name\": \"Bukayo Saka\", \"shot_xg\": 0.01},\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "flow = Flow.from_records(sample_records)\n",
    "\n",
    "grouped = flow.group_by(\"team_name\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can group by multiple keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow.group_by(\"type_name\", \"player_name\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Aggregating Groups with `.summary(...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a group, use `.summary(...)` to compute one or more aggregations per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Sum xG per team\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = (\n",
    "    flow\n",
    "    .group_by(\"team_name\")\n",
    "    .summary(total_xg=(\"shot_xg\", \"sum\"))\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(result.collect())\n",

    "### Example: Shots and xG per player\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.matchflow import where_equals\n",
    "\n",
    "player_summary = (\n",
    "    flow\n",

    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Built-in Aggregation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow supports many built-in aggregators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `count`, `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `median`, `std`, `var`\n",
    "- `first`, `last`, `mode`, `range`, `nunique`\n",
    "- `all`, `any`, `prod`\n",
    "- Custom callables or lambdas\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Custom Aggregation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to calculate a custom stat, like shots on target %?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def shot_accuracy(rows):\n",
    "    outcomes = [\"Goal\", \"Saved\"]\n",
    "    shots = [r for r in rows if r.get(\"shot_outcome_name\")]\n",
    "    if not shots:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    return 100 * sum(r[\"shot_outcome_name\"] in outcomes for r in shots) / len(shots)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = (\n",
    "    flow\n",
    "    .filter(where_equals(\"type_name\", \"Shot\"))\n",
    "    .group_by(\"player_name\")\n",
    "    .summary(sot_percentage=shot_accuracy)\n",

    "## üîÑ Rolling and Time-Based Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to simple group summaries, Flow provides powerful tools to aggregate events across time windows. These are especially useful for event-based data like football matches, where you'd like to calculate rolling metrics or fixed interval summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Rolling Summaries: .rolling_summary(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling summaries compute an aggregation for each row, based on a moving window of previous rows. This is useful for things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- xG over the previous 5 minutes\n",
    "- Cumulative passes in the last 10 events\n",
    "- Momentum metrics that change throughout a match\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import timedelta\n",
    "\n",
    "result = (\n",
    "    flow\n",
    "    .filter(where_equals(\"type_name\", \"Shot\"))\n",
    "    .assign(\n",
    "        timestamp=lambda r: timedelta(\n",
    "            minutes=r[\"minute\"], \n",
    "            seconds=r.get(\"second\", 0)\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .group_by(\"team_name\")\n",
    "    .sort_by(\"timestamp\")  # Important: sort within groups!\n",
    "    .rolling_summary(\n",
    "        window=\"5m\", \n",
    "        time_field=\"timestamp\",\n",
    "        aggregators={\n",
    "            \"xg\": (\"sum\", \"shot_xg\"),\n",
    "            \"shots\": (\"count\", \"shot_xg\")\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .select(\"team_name\", \"timestamp\", \"xg\", \"shots\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "result.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The window can be either a time string (`\"5m\"`, `\"30s\"`, `\"1h\"`) or an integer (number of rows).\n",
    "- Always `.sort_by()` on your time field after grouping: this ensures the rolling window works as intended.\n",
    "- The function emits one row per input row, where each aggregation is computed over the previous window of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚è±Ô∏è Fixed Time Buckets: `.time_bucket(...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want non-overlapping, regular time intervals (e.g. total xG every 5 minutes), use `.time_bucket()`. This partitions your data into uniform windows and computes aggregates for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = (\n",
    "    flow\n",
    "    .filter(where_equals(\"type_name\", \"Shot\"))\n",
    "    .assign(\n",
    "        timestamp=lambda r: timedelta(\n",
    "            minutes=r[\"minute\"], \n",
    "            seconds=r.get(\"second\", 0)\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .group_by(\"team_name\")\n",
    "    .time_bucket(\n",
    "        freq=\"5m\",\n",
    "        time_field=\"timestamp\",\n",
    "        label=\"left\",   # bucket labeled at start of interval\n",
    "        aggregators={\n",
    "            \"xg\": (\"sum\", \"shot_xg\"),\n",
    "            \"shots\": (\"count\", \"shot_xg\")\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    .select(\"team_name\", \"bucket\", \"xg\", \"shots\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "result.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `freq` defines the bucket size (e.g. `\"10s\"`,  `\"5m\"`).\n",
    "- You don't need to sort beforehand - `.time_bucket()` handles sorting internally.\n",
    "- The label argument controls whether the bucket timestamp refers to the start (`\"left\"`) or end (`\"right\"`) of each window.\n",
    "- The output field for the bucket timestamp defaults to \"bucket\", but can be renamed via `bucket_name=\"...\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà Aggregating the Whole Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call `.summary()` directly on a `Flow` to compute dataset-wide aggregates without grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "summary = (\n",
    "    flow\n",
    "    .filter(where_equals(\"type_name\", \"Shot\"))\n",
    "    .summary(\n",
    "        total_xg=(\"shot_xg\", \"sum\"),\n",
    "        avg_xg=(\"shot_xg\", \"mean\"),\n",
    "        total_shots=\"count\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(summary.head(1))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.group_by()` groups records by field(s)\n",
    "- `.summary()` applies aggregations to each group (or full dataset)\n",
    "- You can mix built-in aggregators with custom functions\n",
    "- Grouped flows return regular Flow objects - chain `.select()`, `.sort_by()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
