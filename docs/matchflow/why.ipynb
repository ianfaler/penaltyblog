    "# Why Nested Data Isn‚Äôt a Problem - It‚Äôs the Point\n",
    "\n",
    "In football (soccer) analytics, the default approach to working with data is to flatten it into tables. Whether it's passing networks, xG chains, or player event logs, we often reach for `pandas` or SQL to bring structure to chaos. But what if we're flattening too early - or even unnecessarily?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Flow` engine in `penaltyblog` takes a different path. Instead of reducing everything to a rigid table, it treats nested JSON as a first-class citizen - where it belongs, a feature, not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article explores why embracing nested data opens up powerful new workflows, especially for clubs and analysts working with real-world, messy, event-based football data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåé The Nature of Football Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Football data is inherently nested:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"pass\" might contain a start and end location, a pressure flag, and a list of tags.\n",
    "- A \"shot\" might include multiple qualifiers, an assist type, and a freeze frame of defenders.\n",
    "- A \"match\" contains players, teams, events, substitutions, and metadata - all deeply structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we flatten this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We lose structure.\n",
    "- We increase risk of key collisions (e.g. `player.name` vs `team.name`).\n",
    "- We make it harder to model and reason about what‚Äôs actually happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattening too early leads to brittle pipelines and constant cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üå¨Ô∏è Why Nested Data is a Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. It reflects the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested structures mirror the natural hierarchy of football:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matches contain events\n",
    "- Events have players, contexts, and outcomes\n",
    "- Actions have tags, timestamps, and spatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping this structure lets you work with the game as it‚Äôs played, not just as rows in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. It's schema-flexible\n",
    "\n",
    "Different providers (Opta, StatsBomb, Wyscout) use different formats. Trying to flatten these into a single table leads to endless exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pipeline that embraces nesting can adapt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow.select(\"player.name\", \"location.x\", \"location.y\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without caring if `player` is a dict or a flat field. This gives `Flow` the ability to **ingest, normalize, and transform** without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. It's analysis-friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattening forces premature decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do I include all tags or just the first?\n",
    "- How do I encode location - tuple, string, x/y?\n",
    "- What if a freeze-frame includes 10 defenders?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the data nested lets you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loop through freeze frames when needed\n",
    "- Extract only meaningful tags\n",
    "- Plot raw coordinates without munging\n",
    "\n",
    "**You defer decisions until they actually matter.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåü Flow: A Query Engine for Nested JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of flattening:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just point `Flow` at your folder of JSON files\n",
    "- Chain transformations lazily (filter, assign, group_by)\n",
    "- Select nested fields naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "Output to dashboards, notebooks, or summaries without needing pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = (\n",
    "    Flow.from_folder(\"data/events/\") \n",
    "    .filter(lambda r: r[\"type\"] == \"Shot\") \n",
    "    .assign(xT=lambda r: model.predict(r)) \n",
    "    .select(\"player.name\", \"xT\", \"location\") \n",
    "    .to_json(\"shots.json\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns your raw event data into a **queryable, schema-aware** stream, not a rigid table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä When Flattening Still Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "Flattening isn't evil, it‚Äôs just not always the right first step. Use it when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You‚Äôre building reports or exports for BI tools\n",
    "- You‚Äôve standardized your schema\n",
    "- You need fast vectorized ops (e.g. model training)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even then, with `Flow` you can defer flattening until the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow.filter(...).flatten().to_pandas()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Final Thought: Let the Structure Work For You\n",
    "\n",
    "Football data is complex because the game is complex. Embracing nested formats doesn‚Äôt just make life easier, it makes your analysis more robust, expressive, and future-proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `Flow`, you don‚Äôt fight the data. You query it, shape it, and explore it - on your terms, in its native structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the JSON lake era."
