    "Flow is designed for **clarity**, **composability**, and **structured JSON pipelines**. But to use it effectively ‚Äî especially on large or semi-structured data ‚Äî you need to understand how Flow executes and when data is consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Think in DAGs, Not DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow builds a **deferred plan** of steps (like a DAG). Nothing runs until you collect results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flow = Flow.from_folder(\"data/\").filter(...).assign(...).select(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, **no data has been read**.\n",

    "Flow starts processing only when you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.collect()`\n",
    "- `.to_pandas()`\n",
    "- `.to_json()`, `.to_jsonl()`\n",
    "- Iterate over the Flow\n",
    "- Call `.first()`, `.keys()`, `len()`\n",

    "Certain operations require the **full dataset** and will materialize in memory:\n",

    "| ------------- | --------------------------- |\n",
    "| `.group_by()` | Groups must be fully built  |\n",
    "| `.summary()`  | Aggregates need full access |\n",

    "Since `.map()` and `.assign()` modify records, avoid side effects or mutating shared input.\n",

    "## üí° Performance Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prefer `.from_jsonl()` over `.from_json()` for large files\n",
    "- Minimize `.sort_by()` or `.group_by()` until late in pipeline\n",
    "- Use `.filter()` early to reduce data as soon as possible\n",
