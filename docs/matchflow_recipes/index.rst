Matchflow Examples
=============================================

This section shows real-world examples of using **MatchFlow** to explore and analyze StatsBomb event data.
Each recipe is a focused, end-to-end workflow: loading data, transforming it with `Flow`, and visualizing
or exporting the results.

You'll find patterns for:

- Filtering and transforming events
- Calculating per-player or per-team summaries
- Visualizing shots, passes, and duels
- Combining multiple matches
- Building datasets for machine learning or reporting

These notebooks are designed to be practical and adaptable - whether you're a beginner exploring
open data or a practitioner building production pipelines.
