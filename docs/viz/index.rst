Visualizations
==========================

The visualization module offers a high-level interface for plotting football (soccer) data.

At its core is the ``Pitch`` class, which provides flexible tools for rendering scatter plots,
heatmaps, arrows, and moreâ€”mapped directly onto the field of play.
Whether you're exploring tracking data, event locations, or tactical movements, ``Pitch``
helps you visualize it clearly and beautifully.
