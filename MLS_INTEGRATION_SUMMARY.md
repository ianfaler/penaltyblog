# MLS Integration Summary

## Completed Work

I have successfully added comprehensive USA MLS (Major League Soccer) data, teams, and scraping infrastructure to the penaltyblog model. Here's what has been implemented:

### ✅ 1. Team Data & Mappings (`penaltyblog/scrapers/team_mappings.py`)

- **30 MLS teams** with comprehensive name mappings and aliases
- **Eastern Conference (15 teams):** Atlanta United FC, Charlotte FC, Chicago Fire FC, FC Cincinnati, Columbus Crew, D.C. United, Inter Miami CF, CF Montréal, Nashville SC, New England Revolution, New York City FC, New York Red Bulls, Orlando City SC, Philadelphia Union, Toronto FC
- **Western Conference (15 teams):** Austin FC, Colorado Rapids, FC Dallas, Houston Dynamo FC, LA Galaxy, Los Angeles FC, Minnesota United FC, Portland Timbers, Real Salt Lake, San Diego FC, San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders FC, Sporting Kansas City, St. Louis City SC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC
- **Comprehensive aliases** for each team (e.g., "Atlanta United FC": ["Atlanta United", "ATL", "Atlanta", "ATLUTD"])
- **New function:** `get_mls_team_mappings()` for easy access

### ✅ 2. Competition Mappings (`penaltyblog/scrapers/common.py`)

- Added **"USA Major League Soccer"** to `COMPETITION_MAPPINGS`
- **FBRef support** with slug "22" and comprehensive stats list
- **MLS Official** data source integration
- **ESPN** data source with slug "usa.1"

### ✅ 3. League Configuration (`penaltyblog/config/leagues.yaml`)

- **USA_ML** league code properly configured
- **2024 season** as current season
- **Official MLS website** as primary URL template
- **Tier 1** designation as top-level US league

### ✅ 4. MLS Official Scraper (`penaltyblog/scrapers/mls_official.py`)

- **New MLSOfficial class** following existing scraper patterns
- **Teams data method** with conference, founding year, and city information
- **Fixtures scraping** infrastructure with HTML parsing capability
- **Data standardization** using existing penaltyblog functions
- **Error handling** and logging consistent with framework
- **Team mappings integration** for data consistency

### ✅ 5. Framework Integration

- **Updated `__init__.py`** to export MLS scraper and mappings
- **Unified scraper support** with "USA_ML" → "USA Major League Soccer" mapping
- **Import structure** properly configured
- **Backwards compatibility** maintained with existing code

### ✅ 6. Documentation & Examples

- **Comprehensive README** (`MLS_INTEGRATION_README.md`) with usage examples
- **Demo script** (`examples/demo_mls_scraping.py`) showing all functionality
- **Test suite** (`test/test_mls_integration.py`) for validation
- **Code examples** for common use cases

### ✅ 7. Data Structure

**Teams DataFrame includes:**
- `team_name`: Official team name
- `aliases`: List of alternative names/abbreviations  
- `conference`: "Eastern" or "Western"
- `founded`: Year team was founded (1996-2025)
- `city`: Primary city location

**Fixtures DataFrame includes:**
- `team_home`/`team_away`: Team names
- `date`: Match date (standardized format)
- `goals_home`/`goals_away`: Scores when available
- `status`: Match status
- `id`: Unique game identifier

## Verification ✅

The integration has been tested and verified:
- ✅ All 30 MLS teams properly configured
- ✅ Team mappings working correctly
- ✅ Conference structure (15 teams each) accurate
- ✅ Competition mappings added successfully
- ✅ League configuration accessible
- ✅ MLS scraper initializes correctly
- ✅ Data structure follows penaltyblog patterns

## Usage Examples

```python
# Get MLS team mappings
from penaltyblog.scrapers import get_mls_team_mappings
teams = get_mls_team_mappings()

# Initialize MLS scraper
from penaltyblog.scrapers import MLSOfficial
scraper = MLSOfficial(season="2024")

# Get teams data
teams_df = scraper.get_teams()

# Get fixtures (requires internet connection)
fixtures_df = scraper.get_fixtures()

# Use with existing scrapers
from penaltyblog.scrapers import FBRef
if "USA Major League Soccer" in FBRef.list_competitions():
    fbref = FBRef("USA Major League Soccer", "2024", get_mls_team_mappings())
```

## Key Features

1. **Complete Coverage:** All 30 MLS teams with metadata
2. **Data Consistency:** Standardized naming and aliases
3. **Multiple Sources:** FBRef, MLS Official, ESPN support
4. **Conference Aware:** Proper Eastern/Western organization
5. **Future Ready:** Includes 2025 expansion team (San Diego FC)
6. **Framework Integration:** Seamless with existing penaltyblog infrastructure
