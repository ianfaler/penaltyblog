# Real Data Implementation for PenaltyBlog ⚽

## Problem Solved

**BEFORE**: The system was using fake data because the generic HTML parsing approach was unreliable when trying to scrape official league websites.

**AFTER**: The system now uses **real data from proven sources** instead of fake data.

## Solution Overview

Instead of trying to parse random league websites with generic HTML scraping (which was causing fake data issues), we now use **specialized scrapers for proven data sources**:

### 📊 Data Sources Used

1. **FBRef (fbref.com)**
   - Comprehensive football statistics
   - League tables, fixtures, team/player stats
   - Historical data going back years
   - 10+ statistical categories per match

2. **Understat (understat.com)**
   - Expected goals (xG) and advanced metrics
   - Shot maps and player statistics
   - Match predictions and forecasts
   - Quality over quantity data

3. **Football-Data (football-data.co.uk)**
   - Historical results and fixtures
   - Betting odds and market data
   - Reliable CSV format data
   - Extensive historical coverage

## 🏈 Supported Leagues with Real Data

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 1. Created Unified Scraper (`penaltyblog/scrapers/unified_scraper.py`)
- **Coordinates multiple specialized scrapers** instead of generic HTML parsing
- **Maps league codes** (ENG_PL) to data source competitions
- **Handles season format conversion** (2024-25 → 2024 for Understat, 2024-2025 for FBRef)
- **Standardizes output format** across different sources
- **Concurrent scraping** for performance
- **Fallback priority**: FBRef > Football-Data > Understat

### 2. Updated Web Interface (`penaltyblog/web.py`)
- **Changed header**: "Real football data from proven sources: FBRef, Understat, Football-Data"
- **Updated scrape endpoint**: Now uses `unified_scraper` instead of `match_scraper`
- **Enhanced scraping**: Scrapes 5 major leagues (ENG_PL,ESP_LL,GER_BL,ITA_SA,FRA_L1)

### 3. Data Standardization
- **Common column names**: `home`, `away`, `home_score`, `away_score`
- **League metadata**: `league_code`, `country`, `tier`
- **Source tracking**: `data_source` column
- **Extended stats**: xG, shots, cards when available

### 4. Output Management
- **Individual league files**: `England_Premier_League.csv`
- **Combined multi-league file**: `combined_leagues.csv`
- **Dated directories**: `data/2024-01-15/`
- **Deduplication and validation**

## 🚀 Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pyyaml

# List supported leagues
python3 penaltyblog/scrapers/unified_scraper.py --list-supported

# Scrape Premier League
python3 penaltyblog/scrapers/unified_scraper.py --league ENG_PL

# Scrape multiple leagues
python3 penaltyblog/scrapers/unified_scraper.py --league ENG_PL,ESP_LL,GER_BL

# Scrape all supported leagues
python3 penaltyblog/scrapers/unified_scraper.py --all-supported

# Use specific data source
python3 penaltyblog/scrapers/unified_scraper.py --source fbref --league ENG_PL
```

### Web Interface
```bash
# Start web server
python3 -m penaltyblog.web

# Visit http://localhost:8000
# Click "Scrape Fresh Data" to get real data from proven sources
```

## 📈 Benefits

### ✅ Real Data Instead of Fake Data
- **Reliable, consistent data format**
- **Rich statistical information** (xG, shots, cards, etc.)
- **Historical data** going back years
- **Maintained by football analytics community**
- **No more parsing failures** leading to empty/fake data

### ✅ Robust Architecture
